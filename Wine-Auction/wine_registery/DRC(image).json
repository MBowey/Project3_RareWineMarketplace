    "description": "In 2018, at Sotheby’s sale, in New York, an Asian collector paid $558,000 for the 1945 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Romanée-Conti Grand Cru. Eyes popped and jaws dropped. But also, the world record for the highest amount paid for a 750 ml bottle of Burgundy was smashed. Not just that, it also became the most expensive bottle of wine in the world. After all, it is a vintage unicorn wine from a fabled vineyard. The seven fabled red and white wines from the 4.5-acre Romanée-Conti vineyard are the epitome of quality in burgundies. Plus, the year was hot. Thus, the wines were super concentrated. And then the hail and frost caused the production to be small. Only 600 bottles were produced. Most of them are long gone today. The long, complex aromas, layers of earth, and spice flavors that deserved to be savored in every drop and a silky texture packed in the bottle deservedly make it worth more than half a million dollars.",
